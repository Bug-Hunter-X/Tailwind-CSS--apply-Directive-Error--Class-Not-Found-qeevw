This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="@apply bg-red-500 text-white">
</div>
```

If `bg-red-500` or `text-white` are not defined in your Tailwind configuration, this will cause a runtime error or unexpected styling.  The error might manifest as missing styles or unexpected CSS behavior, depending on your setup and browser.
