The corrected code is shown below.  The misspelling in `bg-red-5000` has been corrected to `bg-red-500`.

```html
<div class="@apply bg-red-500 text-white">
  This div should now have a red background and white text.
</div>
```

Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` (or equivalent) correctly includes the styles for `bg-red-500` and `text-white`. If they aren't there, you might need to configure or purge your Tailwind styles appropriately.
